Cyclus Installation Guide

Cyclus uses the CMake cross platform bailed-generator as a build system. TO
simplify the usage of cmake to build Cyclus from source, a python script is
provided with the source.

******************************
Dependencies
******************************

In order to facilitate future compatibility with multiple platforms,
Cyclus is built using `CMake`_. A full list of the Cyclus package
dependencies is shown below:

====================   ==================
Package                Minimum Version
====================   ==================
`CMake`                2.8
`boost`                1.46.1
`libxml2`              2
`libxml++`             2.36
`python`               2.7 or 3.3+
`sqlite3`              3.7.10
`HDF5`                 1.8.4
`Coin-Cbc`             2.5
====================   ==================

You can find `here <DEPENDENCIES.rst>`_  help to install those dependencies for
the major supported system.

******************************
Installation
******************************

Before going further on the installation procedure be sure you have installed
all the required dependencies listed above. You can also find `there
<DEPENDENCIES.rst>`_ instruction to install those dependencies depending of the
system you are working on.

Installing Cyclus from source:
=============================================
 
Assuming you have the dependencies installed correctly, installing Cyclus is
fairly straightforward. You can follow those step the complete the default
installation of Cyclus:

1. Create a folder to host the Cyclus environment: 

.. code-block:: bash
  
  mkdir cyclusENV && cd cyclusENV

2a. Download the source from `there`_.

2b. Or from the Git-repository: 

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/cyclus/cyclus . && git fetch && git checkout master

3. Move into the new Cyclus directory:``cd cyclus``
4. Run the install script:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  python install.py


If you successfully followed the instruction above cyclus binary have been
generated and be placed in the  ``.local/`` in your home directory. 
You need to had ``~/.local/bin`` to the bottom of your ``$PATH``:
.. code-block:: bash
  $> echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' >> .bashrc

Custom Cyclus installation
============================================

The installation using the install script can be customized using the following
flag:

#.  ``-h, --help``                         show the help message and exit
#.  ``--build_dir BUILD_DIR``              where to place the build directory
#.  ``--uninstall``                        uninstall
#.  ``--no-update``                        do not update the hash in version.cc
#.  ``--clean-build``                      attempt to remove the build directory before building
#.  ``-j THREADS, --threads``              THREADS the number of threads to use in the make step
#.  ``--prefix PREFIX``                    the relative path to the installation directory
#.  ``--config-only``                      only configure the package, do not build or install
#.  ``--build-only``                       only build the package, do not install
#.  ``--test``                             run tests after building
#.  ``--coin_root COIN_ROOT``              the relative path to the Coin-OR libraries directory
#.  ``--boost_root BOOST_ROOT``            the relative path to the Boost libraries directory
#.  ``--hdf5_root HDF5_ROOT``              the path to the HDF5 libraries directory
#.  ``--cmake_prefix_path CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` the cmake prefix path for use with FIND_PACKAGE, FIND_PATH, FIND_PROGRAM, or FIND_LIBRARY macros
#.  ``--build_type BUILD_TYPE`` change the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
#.  ``-D VAR``                Set environment variable(s).



 For example, if you have installed coin-Cbc from source or otherwise have it
installed in a non-standard location, you should make use of the
coinRoot installation flag. The otherwise identical process would look
like:

.. code-block:: bash

    .../cyclus/cyclus$  python install.py --coin_root=path/to/coin

CMake Cyclus installation
============================================
If you are ``CMake`` aficionado you can also install Cyclus without using the
install.py python script and use directly ``cmake`` which should look like:


.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir bld
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local/
  make
  make install

As usually you can custom you cmake installation using the proper cmake flag.
All cmake variable can be listed using: ``cmake -LAH``.
The main variable used are:

#. ``COIN_ROOT_DIR`` set Coin-OT library directory 
#. ``BOOST_ROOT``    set Boost liraries directory
#. ``HDF5_ROOT``     set HDF5 root directory
#. ``HDF5_LIBRARIES`` set HDF5 libraries path
#. ``HDF5_LIBRARY_DIRS`` set HDF5 library directory
#. ``HDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS`` set HDF5 include directory

All variable can be set using ``-DMY_VARIABLE=MY_VARIABLES_VALUE``.


******************************
Running Tests
******************************

Installing Cyclus will also install a test driver (i.e., an executable of all of
our tests). We strongly recommend after installing a fresh install of Cyclus, or
any modification on the source code to rerun those tests in order to insure the
proper functioning of Cyclus. You can run the tests yourself via:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cyclus_unit_tests

******************************
Running Cyclus
******************************

You can find instructions for writing an input file for cyclus from `Cyclus User
Guide`_ or use sample input files from `Cycamore Repo`_. Assuming you have some
file `input.xml`, you can run Cyclus via:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cyclus path/to/input.xml

   Resource Specification
     A description of an acceptable/providable resource :ref:`quality
     <resource-quality>` and :ref:`quantity <resource-quantity>`.  A
     specification will be unique to resource types - a nuclear material
     resource specification will contain a description of acceptable isotopic
     composition.

   Price Description
     Compensation required by a supplier for sending a bid resource to a
     consumer. (Perhaps we need a price class that has some richness, fixed
     cost, variable cost... TBD).

   Preference Description
     Information provided to a commodity market for determining
     consumer-supplier resource exchange obligations. It contains a consumer's
     vector of preferences or affinities for each supplier, pertinent bid
     information, and consumer and/or supplier constraints (esp. supplier
     capacity constraints).

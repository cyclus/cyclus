Institutions
============

Institutions in Cyclus are policy implementation vehicles whose goal
is to act as a supply chain system boundary around a set of facilities
who may or may not reside in the same Region. They act as an
enterprise or organization entity, helping inform the decisions of the
facilities they manage. For example, an institution can inform a
consumer facility's preferences if a producer facility exists within
its boundaries. Otherwise the consumer facility may have no preference
among two otherwise equal producer facilities.

Acting further in the role of facility manager, institutions are also
the natural entity to govern the building of new facilities and
decommissioning of old facilities. These decisions are made at the
beginning of a time step during the :ref:`build_phase`. Accordingly,
institutions have a set of facilities which they are able to build and
can respond to requests for new builds given a demand. For example, a
institution that can build power reactors can respond to a request to
build new electrical generation capacity. Similarly, the institutions
are in charge of handling issues related to building decommissioning
during the :ref:`decommission_phase`.

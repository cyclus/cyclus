Overview
========

Institutions in Cyclus are policy implementation vehicles whose goal
is to act as a supply chain system boundary around a set of facilities
who may or may not reside in the same Region. They act as an
enterprise or organization entity, helping inform the decisions of the
facilities they manage. For example, an institution can inform a
consumer facility's preferences if a producer facility exists within
its boundaries. Otherwise the consumer facility may have no preference
among two otherwise equal producer facilities.

Acting further in the role of facility manager, institutions are also
the natural entity to govern the building of new facilities and
decommissioning of old facilities. Accordingly, institutions have a
set of facilities which they are able to build and can respond to
requests for new builds given a demand. For example, a institution
that can build power reactors can respond to a request to build new
electrical generation capacity.

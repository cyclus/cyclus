Overview
========

Regions in Cyclus act as vehicles that implement policies that
determine the character of the flow of resources into and out of their
boundaries as well as policies that determine the growth of various
demands within their boundaries. For example, a Region determines the
power demand within its borders as well as its preference, if any,
among entities that can meet that demand. Additionally, Regions can
place restrictions on the material entering and exiting its
boundaries. For example, a region can place restrictions of flows of
enriched uranium exiting it, say, capping such enrichment at 20 w/o
U-235. Similarly, it could disallows the flow of any materials that
are comprised only of plutonium, mimicking the United State's current
policy posture on reprocessing.

/// @class RequestPortfolio
/// 
/// @brief A RequestPortfolio is a group of (possibly constrainted) requests for
/// resources
///
/// The portfolio contains a grouping of resource requests that may be mutually
/// met by suppliers. These requests may share a common set of
/// constraints. Take, for instance, a facility that needs fuel, of which there are
/// two commodity types, fuelA and fuelB. If some combination of the two suffice
/// the facility's needs, then requests for both would be added to the portfolio
/// along with a capacity constraint.
///
/// An option exists to add a default mass based constraint that incorporates
/// multicommodity requests, but it must be called manually once all requests
/// have been added, e.g.,
/// @begincode
/// 
/// RequestPortfolio<SomeResource>::Ptr rp(new RequestPortfolio<SomeResource>());
/// // add some requests
/// rp->AddRequest(/* args */);
/// // declare some of them as multicommodity requsts (i.e., any one will
/// // satisfy this demand).
/// rp->AddMutualReqs(/* args */);
/// // add the default constraint
/// rp->AddDefaultConstraint();
/// 
/// @endcode
///
/// A default constraint will add unity for normal requests in the portfolio,
/// but will add a weighted coefficient for requests that meet the same mutual
/// demand. For example, if 10 kg of MOX and 9 kg of UOX meet the same demand
/// for fuel, coefficients are added such that a full order of either will
/// determine the demand as "met". In this case, the total demand is 9.5, the
/// MOX order is given a coefficient of 9.5 / 10, and the UOX order is given a
/// coefficient of 9.5 / 9.

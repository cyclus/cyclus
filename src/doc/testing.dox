@page testing Testing Cyclus
@brief A discussion of concepts and guidelines for creating tests within Cyclus. 

@section googletest Google Test Framework 

The Cyclus code uses the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/"> Google Testing Framework.</a>
is a tool which will assist Cyclus developers in incorporating tests for their 
modules. The framework is integrated with `CMake` with the use of gtest.cc 
gtest_main.cc and gtest.h.  The Google Test 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Primer">primer</a>
is recommended as an introduction to the fundamental 
concepts of unitesting with Google Test.

@section unittests Unit Tests
  Unit tests are written for each new unit of functionality to assure 
  correct behavior. A Cyclus unit test should:
    * Sufficiently verify the expected behavior of a unit of functionality
    * Sufficiently verify expected behavior for boundary cases 
    * Be written simply 

  A good tutorial on how to write good unit tests can be found at 
  <a 
  href="http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/test/introduction/">software-carpentry.org</a>.

  
  Cyclus test coverage should mimic the hierarchical structure of the source 
  code. Each class should have a corresponding Test Case that challenges the 
  robustness of its interface.
  
  An interface consists of the functions, 
  constructors, and data retrievers with which the rest of the code interacts 
  with that class. Each of these functions, constructors, and data retrievers 
  should be challenged by a Test within the Test Case for that class. 
  
  
  Many of 
  these tests will require the use of Fixtures, which will represent canonical 
  Cyclus objects such as Materials, Commodities, Markets, Facilities and 
  Messages. These Fixtures will be shared by many Tests and sometimes many Test 
  Cases.

  To create a Test Case and a suite of Tests for the ToasterFacility

@section acceptancetests Acceptance Tests 

  If you are a developer, you may write a module that is intended to be a 
  concrete implementation of a FacilityModel or other interface type.

  To ensure that your code satisfies the basic requirements of the interface
  which it is intended to be satisfy, the Cyclus core developers have 
  created parameterized abstract interface tests that must be instantiated with 
  your concrete model in order for it to be accepted into the cyclus module 
  library. 

  The interface for our ToasterFacility can be tested by including 
  FacilityModelTests.h in the beginning of the file, ensuring that 
  FacilityModelTests.cpp is linked to the CyclusUnitTestDriver executable, and 
  declaring the implementation of the parameterized test by providing a 
  reference to a constructor to a concrete ToasterFaclity.
  
  @code 
  // ToasterFacilityTests.cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>
  #include "FacilityModelTests.h"

  FacilityModel* ToasterFacilityConstructor(){
    return new ToasterFaclity();
  }

  INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P(ToasterFac, 
                          FacilityModelTests, 
                          Values(&ToasterFacilityConstructor));
  @endcode

@section testcases Test Cases

  Test Cases are logical groupings of Tests. For Cyclus, each class, such as the 
  ToasterFacility should have its own Test Case defined within a file called 
  ToasterFacilityTests.cpp or something similar. 
  
  The ToasterFacilityTests.cpp file should be placed in the 
  appropriate directory within the code as well. Specifically, it should be 
  placed in the trunk/src/Facility/ToasterFacility/ folder with the other 
  ToasterFacility files. 

  The Test Case is a class declared in this file. The Cyclus convention is to 
  give the class the same name as the file. For the ToasterFacility, this class 
  will look like:

  @code
  // ToasterFacilityTests.cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>
  #include "ToasterFacility.h"

  using namespace std;

  //- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  class ToasterFacilityTest : public ::testing::Test {
  protected:
    virtual void SetUp(){
    };

    virtual void TearDown() {
    }
  };

  @endcode

@section tests Tests with Fixtures

Tests are performed on single units of functionality within Cyclus. For Cyclus, 
  imagine that the ToasterFacility class has a function called addHeat(double 
  to_set) which increases the current_bread_temp_ data member value. Knowing 
  very little about the function, we should check that if to_set is positive, 
  the current_bread_temp_ increases, and if to_set is negative, the 
  current_bread_temp_ decreases. 
  
  A test within the ToasterFacilityTest Test Case will need to utilize a 
  concrete instance of a ToasterFacility to check this. 
  
  To test the internals of the ToasterFacility class, such as private data 
  members like current_bread_temp_ a fixture needs to be created in the setup 
  step. A very simple class is created in order to supply a public getter 
  function for the current_bread_temp_ variable.


  @code
  // ToasterFacilityTests.cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>
  #include "ToasterFacility.h"
  #include "TestInst.h"
  #include "CycException.h"

  using namespace std;

  //- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  class FakeToasterFacility : public ToasterFacility {
    public:
      FakeToasterFacility() : ToasterFacility() {
      }

      virtual ~FakeToasterFacility() {
      }

      double getBreadTemp(){return current_bread_temp_;
  };
  //- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  class ToasterFacilityTest : public ::testing::Test {
  protected:
    FakeToasterFacility* src_facility;

    virtual void SetUp(){
      src_facility = new FakeToasterFacility();
      src_facility->setParent(new TestInst());
    };

    virtual void TearDown() {
      delete src_facility;
    }
  };
  @endcode 

  For a tutorial on the 
  use of Googletest for creating and using Fixtures, please see the Googletest 
  primer section on 
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Primer#Test_Fixtures:_Using_the_Same_Data_Configuration_for_Multiple_Te">fixtures</a>.

Now that the fixture setup and teardown are in place, it is possible to add a
test (with access to the fixture to ToasterFacilityTests.cpp.

  @code
  //- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
  TEST_F(ToasterFacilityTest, AddingHeat) {
    double original_temp = src_facility->getBreadTemp();
    EXPECT_NO_THROW( src_facility->addHeat(2.0) );
    double warm_temp = src_facility->getBreadTemp(); 
    EXPECT_GT(warm_temp, original_temp;)
    EXPECT_NO_THROW( src_facility->addHeat(-2.0) );
    double cool_temp = src_facility->getBreadTemp(); 
    EXPECT_LT(cool_temp, warm_temp;)
  }
  @endcode



@section assertions Assertions 

  As in the example above, Each test will be one or more assertions. Assertions
  test various truth expectations for the boundary cases that might be 
  encountered by the function.  
  
  With the Google Test framework, it is easy to make some assertions 
  fatal and some nonfatal. That is, for nonfatal assertions, the test continues 
  but for fatal assertions the test ceases to continue. In googletest, fatal 
  assertions are called with the macros that begin with the word EXPECT 
  (EXPECT_EQ(), EXPECT_LE(), EXPECT_GE()...). For things that absolutely must be 
  the case for us to trust the results of following tests, 

  @code
  TEST_F(ToasterFacilityTests, addZeroHeat){
    double original_temp = src_facility->getBreadTemp();
    EXPECT_NO_THROW( src_facility->addHeat(0.0) );
    double new_temp = src_facility->getBreadTemp(); 
    EXPECT_EQ(new_temp, original_temp);
  }
  @endcode
  
  Nonfatal assertions are macros that 
  begin with ASSERT (ASSERT_EQ(), ASSERT_LE(), ...). 

  @code
  TEST_F(FooTest, heatTransfer){
    double original_temp = src_facility->getBreadTemp();
    src_facility->addHeat(2.0);
    double new_temp = src_facility->getBreadTemp(); 
    ASSERT_EQ((original_temp+2.0),new_temp);
  }
  @endcode
  
  For more information on the googletest assertion syntax please see the 
  Googletest primer section on <a href=http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Primer#Assertions">assertions</a>.


@section runningtests Running the Tests 

  The tests have been incorporated into the default cmake build process.
  To run the test suite, build cyclus and run they `CyclusUnitTestDriver` 
  executible that was built in the Testing directory within your build directory.

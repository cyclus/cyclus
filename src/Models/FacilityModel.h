   @class FacilityModel 
   The FacilityModel class is the abstract class/interface used by all 
   facility models 
    
   This is all that is known externally about facilities 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
    
   The FacilityModel type plays a primary role in Cyclus.  A 
   FacilityModel facility is where offers and requests are generated and 
   transmitted to markets and where shipments of material, issued by the 
   markets, are executed. The algorithms to determine what offers and 
   requests are issued and how material shipments are handled are the 
   primary differentiators between different FacilityModel 
   implementations.  
   Like all model implementations, there are a number of implementations 
   that are distributed as part of the core Cyclus application as well 
   as implementations contributed by third-party developers.  The links 
   below describe additional parameters necessary for the complete 
   definition of a facility of that implementation. 
    
   @section available Available Core Implementations 
    
   - SourceFacility: A facility that can produce a constant (or 
   infinite) amount of some commodity 
   - SinkFacility:  A facility that can consume a constant (or infinite) 
   amount of some commodity 
   - NullFacility: A facility that consumes a constant amount of one 
   commodity and produces a constant amount of another 
    
    
   @section anticipated Anticipated Core Implementations 
    
   Developers are encouraged to add to this list and create pages that 
   describe the detailed behavior of these models. 
    
   - RecipeReactor: A facility that consumes a fixed fresh fuel recipe 
   one a time scale governed by reactor cycle lengths and batch sizes, 
   and produced a fixed/corresponding spent fuel recipe at the same 
   frequency - SeparationsMatrixFacility: A facility that consumes a 
   fixed quantity of material of one commodity and produces many 
   different output streams with the input isotopes distributed across 
   those output streams according to a fixed matrix 
   - EnrichmentFacility: A facility that offers a fixed quantity of SWUs 
   to accomplish isotopic enrichment of material 
    
   @section thirdparty Third-party Implementations 
    
   Collaborators are encouraged to add to this list and link to external 
   pages that describe how to get the models and the detailed behavior

   @class BuildInst 
    
   @section introduction Introduction 
   The BuildInst is an institution type in Cyclus which allows for 
   the building of facilities on its list of available prototypes. 
   The BuildInst does not directly determine when a prototype should 
   be build or which prototype to build; instead this decision is 
   assumed to be made by its parent. Accordingly, the build() 
   method can only be called by its parent. 
    
   @section modelParameters Model Parameters 
   - Vector <Model*> prototypes: The list of prototypes provided by 
   input which are available for this institution to build. 
   Note that the list of facilities built by this Institution is its 
   "children" container, which can be found in the Model class. 
    
   @section detailedBehavior Detailed Behavior 
   The BuildInst starts operation at the beginning of the simulation 
   and ends operation and the end of the simulation. It populates a 
   list of buildable prototypes when it is initialized and determines 
   its region as all Institution models do. When it receives a message, 
   it transmits that message immediately up to its parent or down to its 
   children. Finally, it can build any prototype in its list of avaiable 
   prototypes when prompted via its build() method; however this call 
   must be made by its parent.

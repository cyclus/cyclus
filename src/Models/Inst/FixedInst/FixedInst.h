/**
   @class FixedInst 
    
   @section introduction Introduction 
   The FixedInst is an institution type in Cyclus which is 
   unchanging and is statically associated with facilities that are 
   deployed by some other entity (such as the region or the 
   logician). The FixedInst is instantiated at the beginning of the 
   simulation and exists until the end of the simulation. 
    
   @section detailedBehavior Detailed Behavior 
   The FixedInst starts operation at the beginning of the 
   simulation and ends operation at the end of the simulation. It 
   populates its list of facilities when it is initialized and 
   determines its region as all Institution models do. When it 
   receives a message, it transmits that message immediately up to 
   its region or down to the appropriate facility without making 
   any changes.

   @section intro Introduction 
   The StubCommModel type plays no functional role in Cyclus. It is made 
   available as a skeletal example of a new Communicator model type, 
   showing the breadth and depth of available functional capabilities 
   that must or may be specified in order to create a new Communicator 
   model in Cyclus. In order to implement a new model in Cyclus 
   StubCommModel.h and StubCommModel.cpp may be copied, renamed, and

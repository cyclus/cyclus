/**
   A Message class for inter-entity communication. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
    
   The MessageClass describes the structure of messages that 
   CommunicatorClass models pass during the simulation. 
    
   @section msgStructure Message Data Structure 
    
   Messages have a path and contain a transaction data structure. The 
   path directs the movement of the message through the appropriate 
   channels and the transaction includes information about the material 
   order to be offered, requested, or filled. 
    
   @section path Path 
    
   A message contains a reference (pointer) to its originator and the 
   intended receiver. The message class is designed to facilitate a two 
   leg path. The first leg, the message is in an "outgoing" state. The 
   originator will specify the next stop (next communicator) to receive 
   the message and invoke the sendOn() method of the message. The next 
   stop communicator receives the message, does necessary processing, 
   sets the message's "next stop", and invokes the message's sendOn() 
   method. This process is repeated until the message direction is 
   flipped to the incoming (return leg) state. When in the incomming 
   state, a communicator invokes the sendOn() method and the message is 
   sent to the communicator from which this communicator received the 
   message. An example of the message passing is outlined below:  
   - Up/outgoing message: 
   -# Inside originator 
   -# msg->setNextDest(next_stop) 
   -# msg->sendOn() 
   -# message object invokes receiveMessage(this) for next_stop 
   -# Inside stop A 
   -# msg->setNextDest(next_stop) 
   -# msg->sendOn() 
   -# message object invokes receiveMessage(this) for next_stop 
   -# Inside stop B 
   -# msg->setNextDest(next_stop) 
   -# msg->sendOn() 
   -# message object invokes receiveMessage(this) for next_stop 
   -# Inside stop C 
   -# flip message direction 
   - Down/incoming message: 
   -# Inside stop C 
   -# msg->sendOn() 
   -# message object invokes receiveMessage(this) for stop B 
   -# Inside stop B 
   -# msg->sendOn() 
   -# message object invokes receiveMessage(this) for stop A 
   -# message arrives back at its originating communicator. 
    
   Note that all attempts to specify a "next stop" for a down/incoming 
   message are ignored. Incoming messages simply follow their upward 
   path in reverse order. This paradigm allows for an arbitrary 
   communicator to communicator path (for the outgoing leg). The message 
   is also guaranteed to retrace its path on an incoming leg provided 
   each communicator invokes the message's sendOn() method. 
    
   In order for a message to arrive at the destination as intended by 
   its originator, each communicator may check to see if it is the 
   recipient. If not, it should continue forwarding the message in some 
   defined way (usually up a hierarchy). Attempts to invoke sendOn() 
   without first specifying a next stop will throw an exception (this 
   helps prevent circular/recursive messaging). An exception is also 
   thrown if a communicator attempts to send a message after the message 
   has completed an entire 2-leg round trip 
    
   @section transaction Transaction 
   The transaction contains information about the material order to be 
   offered, requested, or filled. Sufficient information for specifying 
   the transaction follows: 
   - the amount of the given Commodity being offered/requested 
   - the minimum amount acceptible for this transaction 
   - the price of the Commodity 
   - the specific resource to be traded 
    
   Communicator classes which should utilize the MessageClass interface 
   include RegionModel, InstModel, FacilityModel and MarketModel 
   classes. These model classes pass messages during the simulation. 
    
   @section seeAlso See Also 
    
   The CommunicatorClass describes the class of models that pass 
   messages during the simulation. The StubCommModel provides an example 
   of a Message model implementation.

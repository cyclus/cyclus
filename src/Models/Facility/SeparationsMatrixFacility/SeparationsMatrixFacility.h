   @class SeparationsMatrixFacility 
   This FacilityModel is still under construction. 
    
   The SeparationsMatrixFacility class inherits from the FacilityModel 
   class and is dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
   The SeparationsMatrixFacility is a facility type in Cyclus which 
   accepts spent fuel and separates it into multiple reusable material 
   streams and at least one waste stream. The transformation process 
   from spent fuel to streams is dictated by a separation matrix. A 
   SeparationsMatrixFacility offers the various types of separated 
   material on their appropriate markets. Shipments of these materials 
   are executed when a market issues an order that an offer has been 
   matched with a request.  
   @section modelparams Model Parameters 
   SeparationsMatrixFacility behavior is comprehensively defined by the 
   following parameters: 
   - double capacity: The production capacity of the facility (TBD). 
   - int startDate: The date on which the facility begins to operate 
   (months). - int lifeTime: The length of time that the facility 
   operates (months). - double inventorysize: the maximum quantity of 
   material to be held in the inventory 
   - string name: A non-generic name for this facility. 
   - matrix sepMatrix: The separations matrix 
    
   @section optionalparams Optional Parameters 
   SeparationsMatrixFacility behavior may also be specified with the 
   following optional parameters which have default values listed here. 
    
   - double capacityFactor: The ratio of actual production capacity to 
   the rated production capacity. Default is 1 (actual/rated). 
   - double availFactor: The percent of time the facility operates at 
   its capacity factor. Default is 100%. 
   - double capitalCost: The cost of constructing and commissioning this 
   facility. Default is 0 ($). 
   - double opCost: The annual cost of operation and maintenance of this 
   facility. Default is 0 ( $/year). 
   - int constrTime: The number of months it takes to construct and 
   commission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - int decomTime: The number of months it takes to deconstruct and 
   decommission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - Inst* inst: The institution responsible for this facility.  double 
   price: the offer price per kg of processed fuel. Default is 0 ($). 
    
   @section detailed Detailed Behavior 
   The SeparationsMatrixFacility starts operation when the simulation 
   reaches the month specified as the startDate. It immediately begins 
   to request usedFuel material. Each month it continues to request 
   usedFuel at the rate determined by its capacity and offers exactly as 
   much separated material as it has in its inventory. When it receives 
   usedFuel that material is placed into its stocks to await processing. 
   The SeparationsMatrixFacility then processes as much of the material 
   in its stocks as is allowed by its capacity. When it processes some 
   usedFuel into separated streams it adds that amount to its inventory. 
   If an offer is matched with a request, the SeparationsMatrixFacility 
   executes that order by subtracting the quantity from its inventory 
   and sending that amount to the requesting facility. When the 
   simulation time equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the facility 
   ceases to operate.  
   @section example Example Matrix 
   Here, describe how a separations matrix should be constructed and fed 
   into the simulation. 
    
   @section issues Known Issues 
   - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cyclus/issues/detail?id=45"> 
   issue 45</a>: unclear behavior if user does not carefully account for 
   100% of each element across all streams.

/**
   @class StubFacility 
    
   This FacilityModel is intended 
   as a skeleton to guide the implementation of new FacilityModel 
   models.  
   The StubFacility class inherits from the FacilityModel class and is 
   dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
   Place an introduction to the model here. 
    
   @section modelparams Model Parameters 
   Place a description of the required input parameters which define the 
   model implementation. 
    
   @section optionalparams Optional Parameters 
   Place a description of the optional input parameters to define the 
   model implementation. 
    
   @section detailed Detailed Behavior 
   Place a description of the detailed behavior of the model. Consider 
   describing the behavior at the tick and tock as well as the behavior 
   upon sending and receiving materials and messages.

   @class EnrichmentFacility 
   The EnrichmentFacility enriches uranium. 
    
   This class inherits from the FacilityModel class and 
   is dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   This facility model does very little.  New material is added to queue 
   inventory and old material is removed from the same queue inventory. 
    
   @section Introduction 
   The EnrichmentFacility is a facility type in Cyclus which accepts 
   unenriced UF<sub>6</sub> (uuf6) and produces enriched UF<sub>6</sub> 
   (euf6), and depleted uranium tails (tails). An EnrichmentFacility 
   generates appropriately enriched UF<sub>6</sub> and offers that 
   material on the appropriate market. Shipments of this material are 
   executed when the market issues an order that the offer has been 
   matched with a request.  
   @section Model Parameters 
   EnrichmentFacility behavior is comprehensively defined by the 
   following parameters: 
   - double capacity : The production capacity of the facility (SWU's). 
   - double enrichment product fraction 
   - double tails fraction 
   - int startDate : The date on which the facility begins to operate 
   (months). - int lifeTime : The length of time that the facility 
   operates (months). - double inventorysize: the maximum mass quantity 
   of material to be held in the inventory 
   - string name : A non-generic name for this facility. 
    
   @section Optional Parameters 
   EnrichmentFacility behavior may also be specified with the following 
   optional parameters which have default values listed here. 
    
   - capacityFactor : The ratio of actual production capacity to the 
   rated production capacity. Default is 1 (actual/rated). 
   - double availFactor : The percent of time the facility operates at 
   its - capacity factor. Default is 100%. 
   - double capitalCost : The cost of constructing and commissioning 
   this facility. Default is 0 ($). 
   - double opCost : The annual cost of operation and maintenance of 
   this facility. Default is 0 ( $/year). 
   - int constrTime : The number of months it takes to construct and 
   commission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - int decomTime : The number of months it takes to deconstruct and 
   decommission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - Inst inst : The institution responsible for this facility. 
   - double price: the offer price of the enriched UF,,6,, per kg. 
   Default is 0 ($). 
    
   @section Detailed Behavior 
   The EnrichmentFacility starts operation when the simulation reaches 
   the month specified as the startDate. It immediately begins to 
   request unenriched UF<sub>6</sub> material at the rate determined by 
   its capacity and offers exactly as much material as it has in its 
   inventory. When it receives UF<sub>6</sub> that material is placed 
   into its stocks to await processing. The EnrichmentFacility then 
   processes as much of the material in its stocks as is allowed by its 
   capacity.  
   When it processes some unenriched material into enriched UF,,6,, it 
   adds the amount it has produced to its inventory.  If an offer is 
   matched with a request, the EnrichmentFacility executes that order by 
   subtracting the quantity from its inventory and sending that amount 
   to the requesting facility. When the simulation time equals the 
   startDate plus the lifeTime, the facility ceases to operate.

/**
   The NullMarket class inherits from the MarketModel class and is 
   dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   This market will take a set of requests and match the biggest 
   requests with the biggest offers first. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
   The NullMarket is a market type in Cyclus which matches the first 
   offer with the first request for its characteristic commodity. The 
   NullMarket is instantiated at the beginning of the simulation and 
   exists until the end of the simulation. 
    
   @section modelParams Model Parameters 
   NullMarket behavior is comprehensively defined by the following 
   parameters: - Commodity* commod: The type of commodity for which this 
   market accepts offers and requests. 
    
   @section behavior Detailed Behavior 
   The NullMarket starts operation at the beginning of the simulation 
   and ends operation at the end of the simulation. It collects offers 
   and requests for its characteristic commodity and matches offers and 
   requests according to the simplest of algorithms, matching the first 
   offerer with the first requester and setting the amount to be the 
   smallest of the two. Once matches are made, the market dictates the 
   matches back down to the facilities.

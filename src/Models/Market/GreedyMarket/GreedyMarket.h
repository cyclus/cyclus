/**
   The GreedyMarket class inherits from the MarketModel class and is 
   dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   @section introduction Introduction 
   The GreedyMarket is a market type in Cyclus which, when given a list 
   of offers and requests for its characteristic commodity, matches the 
   largest requests first with largest remaining offers. It only matches 
   complete requests and fails only if the full request can't be 
   matched. When these matches are made, it issues an order to the 
   sending and receiving facilities that the offer has been matched with 
   a request. The facilities then conduct the appropriate shipment based 
   on the order message issued to them by the market. 
    
   @section modelParams Model Parameters 
   GreedyMarket behavior is comprehensively defined by the following 
   parameter: - Commodity* commod : The characteristic commodity of this 
   market  
   @section behavior Detailed Behavior 
   All GreedyMarket instantiations occur at the start of the simulation. 
   At each Tick of the timer, the GreedyMarket will receive any offer 
   and request messages associated with its characteristic commodity. 
   When the list of offers and requests are compiled, it handles the 
   offers and requests by descending size. Unless the largest offer is 
   incapable of filling the largest request, the two are matched. Any 
   remaining quantity of the large offer is refiled in the ordered list 
   of offers according to its new size. If the largest offer is smaller 
   than the largest request, the GreedyMarket tries again to match it 
   with the second largest request, and so on. The GreedyMarket proceeds 
   through the ordered list of offers until the largest offer is not big 
   enough to fill the smallest outstanding request.

/// MockSim is a helper for running full simulations entirely in-code to test
/// archetypes/agents without having to deal with input files, output database
/// files, and other pieces of the full Cyclus stack.  This is especially
/// convenient for writing unit-like tests (e.g. using gtest) for your
/// archetype's in-simulation behavior.   Initialize the MockSim indicating the
/// archetype you want to test and the simulation duration.  Then add any
/// number of sources and/or sinks to transact with your agent.  They can have
/// specific recipes (or not) and their deployment and lifetime (before
/// decommissioning) can be specified too.  Here is an example using the
/// agents:Source archetype in Cyclus as the tested agent:
///
/// @code
///
/// cyclus::CompMap m;
/// m[922350000] = .05;
/// m[922380000] = .95;
/// cyclus::Composition::Ptr fresh = cyclus::Composition::CreateFromMass(m);
///
/// std::string config =
///     "<commod>enriched_u</commod>"
///     "<recipe_name>fresh_fuel</recipe_name>"
///     "<capacity>10</capacity>";
///
/// int dur = 10;
/// cyclus::MockSim sim(cyclus::AgentSpec(":agents:Source"), config, dur);
/// sim.AddSink("enriched_u").Finalize();
/// sim.AddRecipe("fresh_fuel", fresh);
/// int src_id = sim.Run(); // capture the agent ID of the facility being tested
///
/// @endcode
///
/// Querying the results can be accomplished by getting a reference to the
/// in-memory database generated.  Not all data that is present in normal
/// full-stack simulations is available.  However, most of the key core tables
/// are fully available.  Namely, the Transactions, Composition, Resources,
/// ResCreators, AgentEntry, and AgentExit tables are available.  Any
/// custom-tables created by the tested archetype will also be available.  Here
/// is a sample query and test you might write if using the googletest
/// framework:
///
/// @code
///
/// // return all transactions where our source facility is the sender
/// std::vector<cyclus::Cond> conds;
/// conds.push_back("SenderId", "==", src_id);
/// cyclus::QueryResult qr = sim.db().Query("Transactions", &conds);
/// int n_trans = qr.rows.size();
/// EXPECT_EQ(10, n_trans) << "expected 10 transactions, got " << n_trans;
///
/// // reconstruct the material object for the first transaction
/// int res_id = qr.GetVal<int>("ResourceId", 0);
/// cyclus::Material::Ptr m = sim.GetMaterial(res_id);
/// EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(10, m->quantity());
///
/// // confirm composition is as expected
/// cyclus::toolkit::MatQuery mq(m);
/// EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(0.5, mq.mass(922350000));

/// MatlBuyPolicy performs semi-automatic inventory management of a material
/// buffer by making requests and accepting materials in an attempt to fill the
/// buffer fully every time step according to an (s, S) inventory policy (see
/// [1]).
///
/// For simple behavior, policies virtually eliminate the need to write any code
/// for resource exchange. Just assign a few policies to work with a few buffers
/// and focus on writing the physics and other behvavior of your agent.  Typical
/// usage goes something like this:
///
/// @code
/// class YourAgent : public cyclus::Facility {
///  public:
///   ...
///
///   void EnterNotify() {
///     cyclus::Facility::EnterNotify(); // always do this first
///
///     policy_.Init(this, &inbuf_, "inbuf-label").Set(incommod, comp).Start();
///   }
///   ...
///
///  private:
///   MatlBuyPolicy policy_;
///   ResourceBuff inbuf_;
///    ...
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// The policy needs to be initialized with its owning agent and the material
/// buffer that is is managing. It also needs to be activated by calling the
/// Start function for it to begin participation in resource exchange.  And
/// don't forget to add some commodities to request by calling Set.  All policy
/// configuration should usually occur in the agent's EnterNotify member
/// function.

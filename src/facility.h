/// @class Facility
/// The Facility class is the abstract class/interface used by all
/// facility agents
///
/// This is all that is known externally about facilities
///
/// @section intro Introduction
///
/// The Facility type plays a primary role in Cyclus.  A Facility
/// facility is where offers and requests are generated and transmitted to a
/// ResourceExchange and where shipments of material, issued by the exchange,
/// are executed. The algorithms to determine what offers and requests are
/// issued and how material shipments are handled are the primary
/// differentiators between different Facility implementations.
///
/// Like all agent implementations, there are a number of implementations that
/// are distributed as part of the core Cyclus application as well as
/// implementations contributed by third-party developers.  The links below
/// describe additional parameters necessary for the complete definition of a
/// facility of that implementation.
///
/// @section available Available Core Implementations
///
/// - SourceFacility: A facility that can produce a constant (or
/// infinite) amount of some commodity
/// - SinkFacility:  A facility that can consume a constant (or infinite)
/// amount of some commodity
/// - NullFacility: A facility that consumes a constant amount of one
/// commodity and produces a constant amount of another
///
///
/// @section anticipated Anticipated Core Implementations
///
/// Developers are encouraged to add to this list and create pages that
/// describe the detailed behavior of these agents.
///
/// - RecipeReactor: A facility that consumes a fixed fresh fuel recipe
/// one a time scale governed by reactor cycle lengths and batch sizes,
/// and produced a fixed/corresponding spent fuel recipe at the same
/// frequency - SeparationsMatrixFacility: A facility that consumes a
/// fixed quantity of material of one commodity and produces many
/// different output streams with the input nuclides distributed across
/// those output streams according to a fixed matrix
/// - EnrichmentFacility: A facility that offers a fixed quantity of SWUs
/// to accomplish enrichment of material
///
/// @section thirdparty Third-party Implementations
///
/// Collaborators are encouraged to add to this list and link to external
/// pages that describe how to get the agents and the detailed behavior

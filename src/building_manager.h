/**
  The BuildingManager class is a managing entity that makes decisions
  about which objects to build given certain conditions.

  Specifically, the BuildingManager queries the SupplyDemandManager
  to determine if there exists unmet demand for a Commodity, and then
  decides which object(s) amongst that Commodity's producers should be
  built to meet that demand. This decision takes the form of an
  integer program:

  \f[
  \min \sum_{i=1}^{N}n_i*c_i \\
  s.t. \sum_{i=1}^{N}n_i*\phi_i \ge \Phi \\
  n_i \in [0,\infty) \forall i \in I, n_i integer
  \f]

  Where n_i is the number of objects of type i to build, c_i is the
  cost to build the object of type i, \f$\phi_i\f$ is the nameplate
  capacity of the object, and \f$\Phi\f$ is the capacity demand. Here
  the set I corresponds to all producers of a given commodity.

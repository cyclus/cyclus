/**
   provide interface to libxml for all input parsing needs 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
   This class provides a convenient set of functions to validate, load, 
   parse, search and extract data from an XML input file.  Features 
   include RelaxNG schema validation and nested inclusion of libraries 
   with disambiguating namespace modifiers. 
    
   To facilitate the nested inclusion of libraries, a structure is 
   defined to hold information about the current XML document.  These 
   objects are placed on a stack to manage an infinite amount of 
   nesting.  
   This class is implemented as a singleton with preferred access 
   through the pre-processor-defined XMLinput macro

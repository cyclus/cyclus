   @class XMLQueryEngine

   A class for extracting information from XML snippets

   This class provides a simple mechanism for retreiving information
   from an XML snippet using the XPath query infrastructure.

   A new object is formed from a std::string snippet of XML,
   immediately creating an XML document object based on that snippet
   and an XPath search context based on that document object.

   These objects retain some state information from each query.  When
   a query matches, the object itself stores the number of matches
   that were found and the lsit of matches as an xmlXPathObject.

   When performing an XPath search for a given string expression,
   there may be multiple matches and each match may have multiple
   children.  This class provides methods to get the full contents of
   each match, or each child of each match.

* initalize file pointer
* validate file
* initializeSimulationTimeData
   * [Timer::Initialize(snippet)]
* load non-modules (elements)
   * load recipe information [XMLFileLoader::load_recipes]
      * find & parse recipe_catalogs
          * initialize recipes with catalog-derived data [RecipeLibrary::Load_recipe(snippet, namespace)]
      * initialize recipes with top-level data [RecipeLibrary::Load_recipe(snippet, namespace)]
* load dyn-modules
   * get list of dyn-module types from Model static member
   * loop over that list of modeltypes
      * XMLFileLoader::load_dynmodules(modeltype,Xpath)  
          N.B. this requires the fileloader to have a map of modeltype->Xpath
          N.B. we need to think about how to manage prototpye catalogs
          at this time since that's different from other dynmodules.
          * Model::factory(modeltype,snippet)
          N.B. the model factory will determine how to handle loading of different model types
               as it does now (elements vs. entities, for example)

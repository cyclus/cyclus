/**
   IntrusiveBase provides a base class that fulfulls basic requirements 
   for a (sub) class to be used in a boost::intrusive_ptr. 
    
   Allows subclasses to track their reference count via the onboard 
   "counter_" member variable. To use a class as a boost::intrusive_ptr, 
   it should inherit from IntrusiveBase with default access (NOT 
   public). All destructors of subclasses (and subsub, etc.) should be 
   virtual to ensure memory deallocation occurs properly for objects 
   that have been up-casted:  
   @code 
   class Resource: IntrusiveBase<Resource> { 
   ... 
   virtual ~Resource(); 
   ... 
   } 
    
   int main(...) { 
   boost::intrusive_ptr<Resource> Resource(new Resource()); 
   boost::intrusive_ptr<Resource> resource2(new Resource()); 
    
   // use resource as if it were a regular pointer, e.g. 
   double quantity = resource->quantity(); 
    
   // equals operator compares raw pointer values: 
    
   // always true 
   if (resource == resource) {} 
    
   // always false 
   if (resource == resource2) {} 
    
   // don't worry about deallocation - it will be automatic. 
   } 
   @endcode

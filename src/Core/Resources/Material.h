   @class Material
  
    The Cyclus Material class provides the data structure that supports 
   the isotopic composition of materials passed around in a Cyclus simulation 
   and the functions as the interface with which models interact 
   with materials.
  
   @section intro Introduction
  
   This class keeps track of the isotopic composition of a material.
   Composition can be queried as either atom-based (moles) or mass-based (kg).
   The material state is book-kept each time a material object is transacted
   between simulation agents.
  
   @section dataTables Data Tables
   Material data can be added with a Table class. This is currently under 
   development for the MassTable.
  
   @subsection interface Interface Models in a Cyclus simulation must interact
   with materials in order to perform their fuel cycle tasks. Some models will
   need to create, destroy, query and alter materials and their compositions.
   In order to do this, the Material class, in concert with the IsoVector
   class, provides an interface that supports these actions by any model that
   includes its header file.
  
   @section modifyMaterials Modifying Materials
  
   Most interaction with material objects will take the form of checking their
   composition properties by querying the material object's stored IsoVector.
   The only methods available to modify the material object are the 'absorb'
   and 'extract' methods.  Changing a material object's composition is not
   possible.  If the composition needs to be changed, a new material object
   will need to be created with the desired composition.  In general, the
   setQuantity method should NOT be used to change the mass of a material
   object. An IsoVector containing the desired composition and mass properties
   should be configured prior to the material object creation

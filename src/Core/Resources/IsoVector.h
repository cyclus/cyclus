/** 
    @class IsoVector
    
    @section Introduction
    The IsoVector class is designed to intelligently manage a given 
    isotopic composition in the form of a CompMap. Specifically, the IsoVector 
    class defines all relevant operators to manage the decay, mixing, and 
    separation of compositions.

    While a CompMap stores a normalized composition, an IsoVector provides
    methods to combine different compositions.

    @section Addition
    Addition of compositions is a specific case of the mix() method. All
    values of a given composition are added to another at a ratio of 1:1. The
    finalized composition is then normalized.

    @section Subtraction
    Subtraction is not the reverse of addition, because it models the process
    of separation (and calls the separate() method). Isotopic separation removes
    all isotopes at a given efficiency (if the efficiency is less than 1, some
    of those isotopes remain). Subtraction, accordingly, is separation with
    efficiency = 1. All isotopes are removed, and the remaining are normalized.

    @section Decay
    The IsoVector class manages the decay of CompMaps via the decay(time) 
    method. New children will have their parent and decay time set accordingly.

/**
   @class ConditioningFacility 
   This facility accepts material that must be conditioned into a waste 
   form.  
   The ConditioningFacility class inherits from the FacilityModel class 
   and is dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
    
   Place an introduction to the model here. 
    
   @section modelparams Model Parameters 
    
   Place a description of the required input parameters which define the 
   model implementation. 
    
   - string fileformat : Currently supported formats for wasteform 
   tables include hdf5 and csv 
   - string datafile : The filename of the file containing the wasteform 
   tables  
   @section optionalparams Optional Parameters 
    
   none 
    
   @section detailed Detailed Behavior 
    
   Place a description of the detailed behavior of the model. Consider 
   describing the behavior at the tick and tock as well as the behavior 
   upon sending and receiving materials and messages. 
    
   @subsection tick handleTick 
    
   On the tick the ConditioningFacility makes requests for each  of the 
   waste commodities (streams) that its table addresses. It also makes 
   offers of any conditioned waste it contains. 
    
   @subsection tock handleTock 
    
   On the tock the ConditioningFacility first prepares transactions by 
   preparing and sending material from its stocks all material in its 
   stocks up to its monthly processing  capacity. 
    
   @subsection receivemessage receiveMessage 
    
   The ConditioningFacility throws an exception, as it doesn't deal with 
   messages.  
   @subsection removeResource removeResource 
    
   Sends the material from the inventory to fulfill transactions. 
    
   @subsection addResource addResource 
    
   Puts the material it has recieved in the stocks, to be conditioned on 
   the tick.

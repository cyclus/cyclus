/**
   The NullFacility class inherits from the FacilityModel class and is 
   dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   This facility model does very little.  New material is added to queue 
   inventory and old material is removed from the same queue inventory. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
   The NullFacility is a facility type in *Cyclus* capable of converting 
   a constant amount of a particular commodity type into the same amount 
   of a different commodity type.  A NullFacility generates material of 
   the output commodity type any time that it has been provided with 
   material of the input commodity type. It continuously makes requests 
   for that commodity type and offers the output commodity type when it 
   has some in stock.  
   @section modelParams Model Parameters 
   NullFacility behavior is comprehensively defined by the following 
   parameters: 
   - double capacity: The production capacity of the facility (units 
   vary, but typically kg/month). *Question:* Do we want to allow this 
   to be infinite? 
   - int startDate: The date on which the facility begins to operate 
   (months). - int lifeTime: The length of time that the facility 
   operates (months). - std::string inCommod: The type of commodity that 
   this facility accepts. - std::string outCommod: The type of commodity 
   that this facility produces. 
    
   @section optionalParams Optional Parameters 
   NullFacility behavior may also be specified with the following 
   optional parameters which have default values listed here. 
    
   - double capacityFactor : The ratio of actual production capacity to 
   the rated production capacity. Default is 1 (actual/rated). 
   - double availFactor : The percent of time the facility operates at 
   its capacity factor. Default is 100%. 
   - double capitalCost : The cost of constructing and commissioning 
   this facility. Default is 0 ($). 
   - double opCost : The annual cost of operation and maintenance of 
   this facility. Default is 0 ( $/year). 
   - int constrTime : The number of months it takes to construct and 
   commission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - int decomTime : The number of months it takes to deconstruct and 
   decommission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - Inst* inst : The institution responsible for this facility. 
   - string name: A non-generic name for this facility. 
    
   @section Detailed Behavior 
   The NullFacility starts operation when the simulation reaches the 
   month specified as the startDate. 
    
   Each month, the NullFacility makes a request for the inCommod 
   commodity type at a rate corresponding to the NullFacility capacity 
   less the amount it currently has in its stocks (which begins the 
   simulation empty). It also makes an offer of any materials of the 
   outCommod type in its inventory (which also begins the simulation 
   empty).  
   If a request is matched with an offer, the NullFacility executes that 
   order by adding the quantity to its stocks. It then proceeds to 
   convert the material into the outCommod commod type at the rate 
   defined by its capacity, leaving the isotopic composition and all 
   other material attributes the same. At the end of the month, it adds 
   the quantity of outCommod it has produced to its inventory and offers 
   that cumulative amount to the appropriate market. 
    
   If an offer is matched with a request, the NullFacility executes that 
   order by subtracting the quantity from its stocks and sending that 
   amount to the requesting facility. 
    
   When the simulation time equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the 
   facility ceases to operate.

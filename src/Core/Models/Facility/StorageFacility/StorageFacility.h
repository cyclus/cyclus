   @class StorageFacility 
   This FacilityModel stores material. 
    
   The StorageFacility class inherits from the FacilityModel class and 
   is dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
    
   Place an introduction to the model here. 
    
   @section modelparams Model Parameters 
    
   Place a description of the required input parameters which define the

   @section optionalparams Optional Parameters 
    
   Place a description of the optional input parameters to define the 
   model implementation. 
    
   @section detailed Detailed Behavior 
    
   Place a description of the detailed behavior of the model. Consider 
   describing the behavior at the tick and tock as well as the behavior 
   upon sending and receiving materials and messages.

   @class SourceFacility 
   This FacilityModel provides a simple source of some capacity 
   (possibly infinite) of some commodity/Recipe. 
    
   The SourceFacility class inherits from the FacilityModel class and is 
   dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
    
   @section introduction Introduction 
   The SourceFacility is a facility type in Cyclus capable of providing 
   a finite or infinite supply of a particular material to the 
   simulation.  A SourceFacility generates material of a certain 
   composition and commodity type, then offers that material on the 
   appropriate market. Shipments of this material are executed when the 
   market issues an order that the offer has been matched with a 
   request.  
   @section modelparams Model Parameters 
   SourceFacility behavior is comprehensively defined by the following 
   parameters: 
   -  double capacity: The production capacity of the facility (units 
   vary, but typically kg/month). Capacity is infinite if a negative 
   value is provided. 
   -  int startDate: The date on which the facility begins to operate 
   (months). 
   -  int lifeTime: The length of time that the facility operates 
   (months). -  std::string outCommod: the commodity that this facility 
   produces -  double inventorysize: the maximum quantity of material to 
   be held in the inventory 
   -  double commodprice: the price of the output material PER UNIT 
   -  map<Isos, NumDens> outComp 
    
   @section optionalparams Optional Parameters 
   SourceFacility behavior may also be specified with the following 
   optional parameters which have default values listed here. 
   -  double capacityFactor: The ratio of actual production capacity to 
   the rated production capacity. Default is 1 (actual/rated). 
   -  double availFactor: The percent of time the facility operates at 
   its capacity factor. Default is 100%. 
   -  double capitalCost: The cost of constructing and commissioning 
   this facility. Default is 0 ($). 
   -  double opCost: The annual cost of operation and maintenance of 
   this facility. Default is 0 ( $/year). 
   -  int constrTime: The number of months it takes to construct and 
   commission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   -  int decomTime: The number of months it takes to deconstruct and 
   decommission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   -  Inst* inst: The institution responsible for this facility. 
   -  string name: A non-generic name for this facility. 
    
   @section detailed Detailed Behavior 
   @subsection finite If Finite Capacity: 
   The SourceFacility starts operation when the simulation reaches the 
   month specified as the startDate. It immediately begins to produce 
   material at the rate defined by its capacity. Each month the 
   SourceFacility adds the amount it has produced to its inventory. It 
   then offers to the appropriate market exactly as much material as it 
   has in its inventory. If an offer is matched with a request, the 
   SourceFacility executes that order by subtracting the quantity from 
   its inventory and sending that amount to the requesting facility. 
   When the simulation time equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the 
   facility ceases to operate.  
   @subsection infinite If Infinite Capacity: 
   The SourceFacility starts operation when the simulation reaches the 
   month specified as the startDate. Each month the SourceFacility 
   offers an infinite amount of material to the appropriate market. If 
   there is a request for that material, the SourceFacility executes 
   that order by sending that amount to the requesting facility. When 
   the simulation time equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the 
   facility ceases to operate.  
   @subsection question Question: 
   What is the best way to allow offers of an infinite amount of 
   material on a market?

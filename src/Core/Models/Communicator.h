/**
   An abstract class for deriving simulation entities 
   that can communicate via the Message class. 
    
   @section introduction Introduction 
   The CommunicatorClass must be inherited by all models 
   that pass messages during the simulation. 
    
   @section commModels Communicator Models 
   Classes which should inherent CommunicatorClass functionality 
   include (but may not be limited to) RegionModel, InstModel, 
   FacilityModel and MarketModel classes. These model classes pass 
   messages during the simulation. These include offers and requests 
   for materials as well as completed transactions. 
    
   Each Communicator instance is assigned an ID so that messages 
   can be passed explicitly from one communicator to another. 
    
   @section interface Interface 
   The functionality provided by the CommunicatorClass includes a set 
   of sending and receiving functions. These have default behaviors 
   defined in the CommunicatorClass, but these behaviors may be 
   overriden by the specific model implementation. These functions 
   include: - receiveMessage 
    
   @section seeAlso See Also 
   The MessageClass describes the structure and interface of messages 
   passed between communicators. The StubCommModel provides an example 
   of a Communicator model implementation.

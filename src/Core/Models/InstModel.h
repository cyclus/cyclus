/**
   The InstModel class is the abstract class/interface 
   used by all institution models 
    
   @section introduction Introduction 
   The InstModel type assists in defining the 
   region-institution-facility hierarchy in Cyclus. A InstModel 
   institution is an actor associated with a set of facilities 
   for which it is responsible. An InstModel may be used to help 
   MarketModel implementations to make material routing decisions 
   based on interfacility relationships. Deployment is a primary 
   differentiator between different InstModel implementations. 
    
   Like all model implementations, there are a number of 
   implementations that are distributed as part of the core Cyclus 
   application as well as implementations contributed by third-party 
   developers. The links below descrie parameters necessary for the 
   complete definition of an implemented instituion. 
    
   @section availableCoreImpl Available Core Implementations 
   - FixedInst: This institution is unchanging and is statically 
   associated with facilities that are deployed by some other 
   entity (such as the region or the logician. 
    
   @section anticipatedCoreImpl Anticipated Core Implementations 
   - DeploymentInst: This institution deploys allowed facilities 
   according to a demand curve. 
    
   @section thirdPartyImpl Third Party Implementations

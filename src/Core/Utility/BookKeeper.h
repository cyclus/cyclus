/**
   The BookKeeper is a (singleton) class for handling I/O. 
    
   @section introduction Introduction 
   The Cyclus Book Keeper is a singleton member of the 
   BookKeeperClass. The Book Keeper Instance (BI) manages the 
   access to the simulation's output database. Individual 
   modules create Tables as per their need, and registers them 
   with the Book Keeper. All interaction with the Database is 
   handled by the Book Keeper. 
    
   @section singletonInstance Singleton Instance 
   In order to utilize the database functions stewarded by the 
   Book Keeper, a model must include the Book Keeper header file 
   and call BookKeeperClass functions via the singleton Book 
   Keeper Instance BI. 
    
   @section writeDB Writing the Database File 
   In the long term, the function that writes the output for 
   Cyclus may be of any format. The Book Keeper API is independent 
   of data format. Currently, it interacts with the TableClass 
   and DatabaseClass, both of which are written with respect to 
   SQL, specifically SQLite. The Book Keeper creates a simulation 
   data file as soon as it is initialized. 
    
   @section writeToDB Writing to the Database 
   Under the current Book Keeper paradigm, rows of data are written 
   at intervals described in the TableClass. When a Table reaches 
   a threshold number of row commands, it alerts the Book Keeper, 
   who is allowed to act accordingly.

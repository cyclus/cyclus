/// The material class is primarily responsible for enabling basic material
/// manipulation while helping enforce mass conservation.  It also provides the
/// ability to easily decay a material up to the current simulation time; it
/// does not perform any decay related logic itself.
///
/// There are four basic operations that can be performed on materials: create,
/// transmute (change material composition - e.g. fission by reactor), absorb
/// (combine materials), extract (split a material). All material
/// handling/manipulation will be performed using these operations - and all
/// operations performed will be tracked and recorded. Usage examples:
///
/// * A mining facility that "creates" new material
///
///   @code
///   Composition::Ptr nat_u = ...
///   double qty = 10.0;
///
///   Material::Ptr m = Material::Create(qty, nat_u, ctx);
///   @endcode
///
/// * A conversion facility mixing uranium and flourine:
///
///   @code
///   Material::Ptr uf6 = uranium_buf.PopOne();
///   Material::Ptr f = flourine_buf.PopOne();
///
///   uf6.Absorb(f);
///   @endcode
///
/// * A reactor transmuting fuel:
///
///   @code
///   Composition::Ptr burned_comp = ... // fancy code to calculate burned isotopics
///   Material::Ptr assembly = core_fuel.PopOne();
///
///   assembly.Transmute(burned_comp);
///   @endcode
///
/// * A separations plant extracting stuff from spent fuel:
///
///   @code
///   Composition::Ptr comp = ... // fancy code to calculate extraction isotopics
///   Material::Ptr bucket = spent_fuel.PopOne();
///   double qty = 3.0;
///
///   Material::Ptr mox = bucket.ExtractComp(qty, comp);
///   @endcode

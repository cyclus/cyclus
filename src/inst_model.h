/**
   The InstModel class is the abstract class/interface
   used by all institution models

   @section introduction Introduction
   The InstModel type assists in defining the
   region-institution-facility hierarchy in Cyclus. A InstModel
   institution is an actor associated with a set of facilities
   for which it is responsible. An InstModel may be used to help
   MarketModel implementations to make material routing decisions
   based on interfacility relationships. Deployment is a primary
   differentiator between different InstModel implementations.

   Like all model implementations, there are a number of
   implementations that are distributed as part of the core Cyclus
   application as well as implementations contributed by third-party
   developers. The links below descrie parameters necessary for the
   complete definition of an implemented instituion.

   @section availableCoreImpl Available Core Implementations
   - FixedInst: This institution is unchanging and is statically
   associated with facilities that are deployed by some other
   entity (such as the region or the logician.

   @section anticipatedCoreImpl Anticipated Core Implementations
   - DeploymentInst: This institution deploys allowed facilities
   according to a demand curve.

   @section thirdPartyImpl Third Party Implementations

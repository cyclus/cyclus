Building Cyclus
------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Cyclus Homepage`_ has much more detailed guides and information.
This Readme is intended to be a quick reference for building cyclus for the
first time.

The Cyclus code requires the following software and libraries.

====================   ==================
Package                Minimum Version   
====================   ==================
`CMake`                2.8            
`boost`                1.34.1
`libxml2`              2                 
`sqlite3`              3.7.10            
====================   ==================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building and Running Cyclus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to facilitate future compatibility with multiple platforms, Cyclus is
built using  `Cmake <http://www.cmake.org>`_. This relies on CMake version
2.8 or higher and the CMakeLists.txt file in `src/`. It is
recommended that you use CMake to build the Cyclus executable external to the
source code. To do this, execute the following steps::

    .../core/$ mkdir build
    .../core/$ cd build
    .../core/build$ cmake ../src

You should see output like this::

    ...
    ...
    >> -- Configuring done
    >> -- Generating done
    >> -- Build files have been written to: .../core/build
    /core/build$ make cyclus
    >> Scanning dependencies of target cyclus
    ...
    ...
    >> [100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/cyclus.dir/SourceFac.cpp.o
    >> Linking CXX executable cyclus
    >> [100%] Built target cyclus

Now, you can make cyclus, and run it with some input file, for this example, call it `input.xml`::

    .../core/build$ make
    .../core/build$ ./cyclus input.xml

The `Cyclus Homepage`_ has much more detailed guides and information.  If
you intend to develop for *Cyclus*, please visit it to learn more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Developer Workflow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note that "blessed" repository refers to the primary `cyclus/core` repository.*

As you do your development, push primarily only to your own fork. Push to
the blessed repository (usually the "develop" branch) only after:

  * You have pulled the latest changes from the blessed repository.
  * You have completed a logical set of changes.
  * Cyclus compiles with no errors.
  * All tests pass.
  * Cyclus input files run as expected.
  * (recommended) your code has been reviewed by another developer.

Code from the "develop" branch generally must pass even more rigorous checks
before being integrated into the "master" branch. Hotfixes would be a
possible exception to this.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Workflow Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Use a branching workflow similar to the one described at
    http://progit.org/book/ch3-4.html.

  * The "develop" branch is how core developers will share (generally compilable) progress
    when we are not yet ready for the code to become 'production'.

  * Keep your own "master" and "develop" branches in sync with the blessed repository's
    "master" and "develop" branches. The master branch should always be the 'stable'
    or 'production' release of cyclus.
    
     - Pull the most recent history from the blessed repository "master"
       and/or "develop" branches before you merge changes into your
       corresponding local branch. Consider doing a rebase pull instead of
       a regular pull or 'fetch and merge'.  For example::

         git checkout develop
         git pull --rebase blessed develop

     - Only merge changes into your "master" or "develop" branch when you
       are ready for those changes to be integrated into the blessed
       repository's corresponding branch. 

  * As you do development on topic branches in your own fork, consider rebasing
    the topic branch onto the "master" and/or "develop"  branches after *pulls* from the blessed
    repository rather than merging the pulled changes into your branch.  This
    will help maintain a more linear (and clean) history.
    *Please see caution about rebasing below*.  For example::

      git checkout [your topic branch]
      git rebase develop

  * In general, **every commit** (notice this is not 'every push') to the
    "develop" and "master" branches should compile and pass tests. This
    means that when you are ready to move changes from one of your topic
    branches into the "develop" branch, you should use a NON-fast-forward
    merge.  For example::
    
      git checkout develop
      git merge --no-ff [your topic branch]
    
    Possible exceptions to this 'no fast-forward' merge
    include:

     - your topic branch consists of only one (compileable and passes
       tests) commit.

     - every commit in your topic branch is compileable and passes tests.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cautions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * **NEVER** merge the "master" branch into the "develop"
    branch. Changes should only flow *to* the "master" branch *from* the
    "develop" branch.

  * **DO NOT** rebase any commits that have been pulled/pushed anywhere
    else other than your own fork (especially if those commits have been
    integrated into the blessed repository.  You should NEVER rebase
    commits that are a part of the 'master' branch.  *If you do, you will be
    flogged publicly*.

  * Make sure that you are pushing/pulling from/to the right branches.
    When in doubt, use the following syntax::

      git push [remote] [from-branch]:[to-branch]

    and (*note that pull always merges into the current checked out branch*)::

      git pull [remote] [from-branch]

An Example

Introduction
============

As this type of workflow can be complicated to converts from SVN and very complicated
for brand new programmers, an example is provided.

For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that we want a single "sandbox" branch
in which we would like to work, i.e. where we can store all of our work that may not
yet pass tests or even compile, but where we also want to save our progress. Let us 
call this branch "Work". So, when all is said and done, in our fork there will be 
three branches: "Master", "Develop", and "Work".

Acquiring Cyclus and Workflow
=============================

We begin with a fork of the main ("blessed") Cyclus repository. After initially forking
the repo, we will have two branches in our fork: "Master" and "Develop".

Acquiring a Fork of the Cyclus Repository
-----------------------------------------

A fork is *your* copy of Cyclus. Github offers an excelent 
`tutorial <http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/>`_ on how to set one up. The rest of this
example assumes you have set up the "upstream" repository as cyclus/core. Note that git
refers to your fork as "origin".

First, let's make our "work" branch:
::

    .../cyclus_dir/$ git branch work
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git push origin work


We now have the following situation: there exists the "blessed" copy of the Master and
Develop branches, there exists your fork's copy of the Master, Develop, and Work branches,
*AND* there exists your *local* copy of the Master, Develop, and Work branches. It is 
important now to note that you may wish to work from home or the office. If you keep your 
fork's branches up to date (i.e., "push" your changes before you leave), only your *local*
copies of your branches may be different when you next sit down at the other location.

Workflow: The Beginning
-----------------------

Now, for the workflow! This is by no means the only way to perform this type of workflow, 
but I assume that you wish to handle conflicts as often as possible (so as to keep their total 
number small). Let us imagine that you have been at work, finished, and successfully pushed 
your changes to your *Origin* repository. You are now at home, perhaps after dinner (let's just 
say some time has passed), and want to continue working a bit (you're industrious, I suppose... 
or a grad student). To begin, let's update our *home's local branches*.
::

    .../cyclus_dir/$ git checkout develop
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git pull origin develop 
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git pull upstream develop
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git push origin develop

    .../cyclus_dir/$ git checkout work
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git pull origin work
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git merge develop
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git push origin work

Perhaps a little explanation is required. We first want to make sure that this new local copy of 
the develop branch is up-to-date with respect to the remote origin's branch and remote upstream's
branch. If there was a change from the remote upstream's branch, we want to push that to origin. 
We then follow the same process to update the work branch, except:

#. we don't need to worry about the *upstream* repo because it doesn't have a work branch, and
#. we want to incorporate any changes which may have been introduced in the develop branch update.

Workflow: The End
-----------------

As time passes, you make some changes to files, and you commit those changes (to your *local work
branch*). Eventually (hopefully) you come to a stopping point where you have finished your project 
on your work branch *AND* it compiles *AND* it runs input files correctly *AND* it passes all tests!
Perhaps you have found Nirvana. In any case, you've performed the final commit to your work branch,
so it's time to merge those changes with the local develop branch and push them to origin's develop
branch: ::

    .../cyclus_dir/$ git checkout develop
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git pull upstream develop
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git merge work 
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git push origin develop

    .../cyclus_dir/$ git checkout work
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git merge develop
    .../cyclus_dir/$ git push origin work

This time we want to update our local develop branch based on the changes we made in work. First we
checkout and update develop in case the upstream develop branch introduced any changes. We then
apply our changes via merging work into develop, and push that back up to origin. In case the upstream
pull did introduce changes, we go ahead and update the work branch on origin.

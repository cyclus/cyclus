=======

This is a temporary directory in the repository intended to hold the contents of 
what will soon become Cycamore.

That is, it is intended to hold the current concrete additional modules 
developed in conjunction with Cyclus as well as a build system that facilitates 
building and installation in tandem with the Cyclus building and installation 
process. 

It is related to github issue 66 : https://github.com/cyclus/core/issues/66 .

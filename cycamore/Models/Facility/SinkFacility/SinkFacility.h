/**
   @class SinkFacility 
   This FacilityModel requests a finite amount of its input commodity. 
   It offers nothing. 
    
   The SinkFacility class inherits from the FacilityModel class and is 
   dynamically loaded by the Model class when requested. 
    
   @section intro Introduction 
   The SinkFacility is a facility type in *Cyclus* capable of accepting 
   a finite or infinite quantity of some commodity produced in the 
   simulation. A SinkFacility requests an amount of that commodity from 
   the appropriate market. It then receives that commodity when the 
   market issues an order that the request has been matched with a 
   corresponding offer.  
   @section modelparams Model Parameters 
   SinkFacility behavior is comprehensively defined by the following 
   parameters: 
   - double capacity: The acceptance capacity of the facility (units 
   vary, but typically kg/month). Capacity is infinite if a positive 
   value is provided. 
   - int startDate: The date on which the facility begins to operate 
   (months). - int lifeTime: The length of time that the facility 
   operates (months). - std::string inCommod: The commodity type this 
   facility accepts.  
   @section optionalparams Optional Parameters 
   SinkFacility behavior may also be specified with the following 
   optional parameters which have default values listed here. 
   - double capacityFactor: The ratio of actual acceptance capacity to 
   the rated acceptance capacity. Default is 1 (actual/rated). 
   - double availFactor: The percent of time the facility operates at 
   its capacity factor. Default is 100%. 
   - double capitalCost: The cost of constructing and commissioning this 
   facility. Default is 0 ($). 
   - double opCost: The annual cost of operation and maintenance of this 
   facility. Default is 0 ($/year). 
   - int constrTime: The number of months it takes to construct and 
   commission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - int decomTime: The number of months it takes to deconstruct and 
   decommission this facility. Default is 0 (months). 
   - Inst* inst: The institution responsible for this facility. 
   - string name: A non-generic name for this facility. 
    
   @section detailed Detailed Behavior 
   @subsection finite If Finite Capacity: 
   The SinkFacility starts operation when the simulation reaches the 
   month specified as the startDate. It immediately begins to request 
   the inCommod commodity type at the rate defined by the SinkFacility 
   capacity. If a request is matched with an offer from another 
   facility, the SinkFacility executes that order by adding that 
   quantity to its stocks. When the simulation time equals the startDate 
   plus the lifeTime, the facility ceases to operate. 
    
   @subsection infinite If Infinite Capacity: 
   The SinkFacility starts operation when the simulation reaches the 
   month specified as the startDate. Each month the SinkFacility 
   requests an infinite amount of the inCommod commodity from the 
   appropriate market. If there is a corresponding offer for that 
   commodity type from another facility, the SinkFacility executes that 
   order by adding that quantity to its stocks. When the simulation time 
   equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the facility ceases to 
   operate.  
   @subsection question Question: 
   What is the best way to allow requests of an infinite amount of 
   material on a market?

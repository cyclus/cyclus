# File: conformDoxygen.py
# Author: Matthew Gidden
# Date: March 28, 2012

# Purpose: 
# To conform all doxygen comments in header files
# to the Cyclus standard.
# Note! This is currently incomplete, read the details below

# Detailed Behavior: 
# This script will recursively perform its operation on 
# every header (.h) file beginning in the current directory.
# In its current implementation, the script will find Doxygen
# code blocks beginning with /** and ending with */. For each
# line in between, if a leading asterisk is used, it will be
# removed. The remaining line will then be indented correctly
# with respect to the leading /**'s indentation. Finally, new
# lines (i.e. blank lines) immediately after the initial /**
# will be removed.

# To Do:
# 1) Change any /*!s to /**
# 2) Auto-remove @briefs
# 3) Change /// to full Doxygen code blocks
